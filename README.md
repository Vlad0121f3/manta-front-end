# Manta Front End

Web app for interacting with Manta Network, Calamari Network, and Dolphin Testnet

## Versioning

The first digit of the version (x in x.y.z) refers to exceptional massive changes across manta front end, other full stack repositories, and the runtime, such as the upgrade to testnet V2 (reusable addresses, major cryptographic changes).

The second digit of the version (y in x.y.z) refers to other changes that are coordinated across multiple full stack repositories, and perhaps also the runtime. For example, an upgraded `manta-wasm-wallet` syncing protocol requiring changes to `manta-front-end`, `manta-wasm-wallet` in sdk, and the runtime would fall under this category.

The third digit of the version (z in x.y.z) refers to changes that only affect the front end. A UI restyle would fall under this category.
